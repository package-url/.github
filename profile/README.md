## Welcome to Package-URL on GitHub

Package-URL is an open source community that develops and supports the Package-URL (PURL) and Version Range (VERS) specifications.
- The PURL specification is an Ecma standard: [ECMA-427](https://ecma-tc54.github.io/ECMA-427/). 
- The VERS specification will be proposed as an Ecma standard in 2026.
- Both standards are managed by the [Ecma Technical Commmittee 54](https://tc54.org/purl/)

We currently host repositories for 12 tools that implement PURL and 2 that implement VERS.

We welcome your participation. Some ways to get started are:
